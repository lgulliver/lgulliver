As a former developer and architect, I have been working in and transforming organisations of varying age and size using Agile and DevOps practices at both a cultural and technical level for the last 15 years before making the move into consulting. My passion is helping organisations achieve higher throughput of delivery of value through happier, more engaged teams.  
 
I am co-founder of the DevOps specialised meetup DevOps Notts in Nottingham, and co-creator and co-host of the Agile Engineering Podcast. I am also an accomplished public speaker, speaking at meetups all over the UK on technical, leadership and cultural DevOps topics. 
 
I have led award-winning distributed and co-located teams that have strived for excellence at every level. I have also designed and implemented scalable, global solutions that utilise microservices architectures for multi-tenant applications along with hybrid-cloud solutions utilising Azure Stack, AKS and Azure Public Cloud.
